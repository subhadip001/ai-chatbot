# Startegy for Stateless Chat Room Using Redis

## Requirements
 - This app should allow user-to-user chat without using Socket.io, meaning it should be stateless.
 - A user can create a unique chat room and share the Room Id with another user to join and start chatting.
 - Utilize Redis for storing and managing chat data.

## Approach
    - Frontend(Next.js)
        - Chat Home Page
            - User can create a new chat room
            - User can join an existing chat room
        - Chat Room Page
            - User can send messages
            - User can see messages from other users

    - Backend(Next.js API)
        - Create Chat Room
            - Generate a unique Room Id
            - Store the Room Id in Redis
        - Join Chat Room
            - Get Room Id from the user
            - Check if the Room Id exists in Redis
        - Send Message
            - Store the message in Redis
        - Get Messages
            - Get all messages from Redis


## Redis Setup
    - Install Redis
    - Start Redis Server
    - Connect to Redis Server
    - Create Redis Client


## Some Improvements can be done

    - Styling
